What could you do if you didn't cut any corners? If you didn't have a deadline to make, or a new feature to implement? What if you could code for fun and focus on each line being tested, readable, and maintainable. What if the perfectionist in you wasn't screaming their head off at the end of the day and you wrote code you wanted to take home and show off to your mom?

Last weekend I had the opportunity to attend a global day of code retreat hosted by Galvanized and 8th Light. The idea behind the code retreat is to get away from pressures of "getting things done" and take some time to enjoy the process of building readable, maintainable code. This code doesn't have to go into production, in fact you don't keep it. You just focus on the process of writing, and writing well.

Having just finished 7 months at Turing School of Software and Design, I feel like all I know is "get things done". With most projects being at the most 2 weeks and feeling the need to succeed most of us rushed through. There was always feedback on how to better the code and continue to improve, which you could implement on the next project. But we improved by implementing that feedback on the next project. Nothing ever quite satisfied the perfectionist in me. I was looking forward to the opportunity to code fun, and for betterment.

### The Structure

The Global day of Code Retreat was an all day event, split up by the hour.

### The Sessions

### Final Questions

<!-- //////////////////////////////
--> What did you learn? What were you surprised by?  What will you take with you?

"Get away from the pressures of getting things done" What could we do. In our day to day jobs, no matter what, we always have this sense of wanting to get things done. We feel we need to deliver or we haven't accomplished. What can we do if we don't cut corners.

So if you had all the time, how would you code?
Most challenging was coding without knowing what your partner was doing/no speaking
Perfect practice makes perfect, not just practice. Day job isn't about writing perfect code.
Even if you write something awful, it's ok. Did you get better at writing code?
TDD focus. Six pairing sessions.


4 Rules of Simple Design: KEEP THESE IN MIND AS YOU CODE TODAY

	0.	Passing tests
	0.	Reveals intent.
	0.	No duplication. Subtly of DRY
	0.	Fewest Elements.

Design patterns -> apply the same semantics to many places in your code
These rules are meant to guide how you think about the problem on a high level
Ping pong TDD

Canonical

Mark Twain --> "I apologize for the length of this letter, I didn't have time to write a shorter one"

TDD, Pairs, 45 minutes, then delete code and swap pairs, quick retrospective afterwards

Challenge sessions:
--> In last five minutes, I want zombie mode for cells and a 3d grid
--> JavaScript --> no method longer than 3 lines, names must be action focused, cannot just name Cell class Cell
--> Go --> Four minute timer, make your partners test pass, write a test, commit all in four minutes. Otherwise, delete the code
--> You cannot have a method that returns a primitive type. You can only return objects that you created.
--> No talking at all
--> Take over someone else's code who just didn't talk to build it and fix what they didn't like -->
